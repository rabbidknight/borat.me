# Welcome to my hell..

Thought was a heavy weight champ,

Was just instincts acting against my clamp;

Who is it to dare for one,

One o' almighty,

I had enough of you for this sensical none..

..

Maybe a machine could perform the same,

Then what am i to behold?

A just nor senseless one, am i 'to blame?

With all the grudges against me you hold..

..


I just wanted to see you face again,

Not this auto correcting help to gain,

A new chapter in life to obtain,

Turns out i was the one who made you felt lame,

May be the cause of your once deep ridden clues,

Surely will be my never-ending nightmarish virtues.

To you or not to you, who am i any'more to lose..
