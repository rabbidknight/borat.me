# Why even bother..


Noone visits anyway.

My message always stays hiding a click away.

May be a problem's got it afar,

As far as i know, a no-man would never set it as to inflict,

Not for personal use, albeit i'm not sure if there's any excuse,

May got it for an applause,

For an internal conflict, i must strictly restrict my improvisation,

On what we settle on for this page,

On what i need to convey, 

On this never-ending lands of foray,

Some far from me, never backing away from thy me.

No-matter the distance, always end up picking up a stance,

As long as these commas go,

May the thoughts of me come and go, 

As i will probably be never set-a-foot, even if yours never stay put,

To my basic knowledge,

That means you;

To not stay under any borderline contradiction,

You always told me as so, to never tear the body apart,

For whatever reason that i, still ondo to try to not hold back,

May you continue to gather more bases.

It may be fragile as a couple of vases,

But in most cases,

I will still continue to believe in you,

No matter whatever it takes, what my hero aces...

Don't stop,

Neither you, the reader,

You don't need to feed the flower.

Why not be your only lover?

A sunday stride should not be a single-go.

Just believe in yourself, where ever you get thrown.

So do i, may never get to see you,

But i will be awaiting you. 

A wait even if takes me ages,

That i'm absolutely sure,

Will give me the courages,

That you have reached your absolute peak,

To never go back, 

To when we were in majors.
